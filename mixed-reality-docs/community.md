# Mixed Reality Community

At Microsoft, we believe that having access to strong communities is essential for the growth of developers, platforms, and ecosystems.  This page is meant to help developers find the many places they can take part in communities, as well as introduce you to some of the team and community members who are here to help you.

## Online Communities

|**HoloDevelopers Slack**|[Join Here](https://aka.ms/holodevelopers)|The HoloDevelopers Slack was initially created as a place for developers exploring HoloLens to get to know one another, form friendships, build trust, and get help from each other.  It has grown into a thriving community that is still focused on these, but conversations that happen there cover the spectrum of mixed reality across many platforms, devices, and companies.|

## Microsoft Mixed Reality MVP's

Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals, or MVPs, are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community. They are always on the "bleeding edge" and have an unstoppable urge to get their hands on new, exciting technologies. They have very deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services, while also being able to bring together diverse platforms, products and solutions, to solve real world problems. MVPs make up a global community of over 4,000 technical experts and community leaders across 90 countries/regions and are driven by their passion, community spirit, and quest for knowledge. Above all and in addition to their amazing technical abilities, MVPs are always willing to help others - that's what sets them apart.
